    "1. **Gender and Survival:**\n",
    "   - Females had a much higher survival rate than males.\n",
    "   - This aligns with the \"women and children first\" rescue approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class and Survival:**\n",
    "   - Passengers in **1st class** had a significantly higher survival rate.\n",
    "   - Survival rate decreased with lower classes (Pclass 3 had the lowest).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Age Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Most passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.\n",
    "   - There were fewer very old or very young passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlations:**\n",
    "   - `Pclass` has a negative correlation with survival (higher class â†’ more survival).\n",
    "   - `Sex` is strongly correlated with survival (being female â†’ higher chance).\n"
